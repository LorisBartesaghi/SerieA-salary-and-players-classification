# SerieA-salary-and-players-classification
The starting point of the analysis is the observation of the increasing salaries of football
players in the last years. The main goal of this project is to provide a statistical analysis
on football players’ salaries and performance, an attempt to evaluate the ability of teams’
management to correctly evaluate the performance of players and the correct level of
the relative salaries and an approach to decrease the number of overpaid players, hiring
athletes with the same characteristics but with low salary. Random forest and forward
stepwise regression are used to select most relevant variables. Linear regression is applied
on the selected variables to understand the impact of variables on gross salary. Residuals
are considered as a measure to comprehend if a player is underpaid or overpaid, and a
logistic regression is applied to compute the probability of being overpaid if an athletes
had signed to a particular team. Clustering is applied to group players with the same
characteristics and to provide meaningful substitute to overpaid players.
